# SimpleLibrarySystem
Web library system created to show some of my knowledge around C# language. Used .Net core Blazor and Entity Framework with SQL server database.
Basically this system is built around database from which app is reading all of necessary data like customers and books collection. Then we can perform some of actions like borrowing book or return it. We can add new books and customers to database or delete them if it's needed. Also there is report page which is showing all books which are borrowed and theirs end dates.

This web app is available on [my page](http://thdev.hostingasp.pl/).

Functionalities of web app:
-reading data from database
-writing new records to tables
-analyzing data from database - locking some functions when conditions aren't met
-working translation system

Also you can check my [portfolio page](https://thdev.eu/). where I showed some of my other projects from past( mostly game development ).
